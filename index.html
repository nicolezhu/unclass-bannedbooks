								<p>Imagine yourself reading this as a 17-year-old. Could you handle it?</p>
								<p>These sentences are just some of several controversial lines in the <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>. The narrator in Sherman Alexie's award-winning novel is 14-year-old Junior, a boy who leaves the Spokane Indian reservation for an all-white public high school in pursuit of a better education. Fans and educators praise the novel for its frank coming-of-age portrayal of Junior’s hardships growing up on “the rez.”</p>
 								<p>It's also the most controversial novel of the year, according to Deborah Caldwell of the American Library Association. The book was challenged and temporarily removed from the Meridian school district's supplemental book list Idaho. Parents raised concerns about profane, racist and sexual language, prompting the Meridian school board to vote 2-1 to place a temporary hold on the book until it found a more appropriate replacement. This decision came despite a petition signed by 350 students asking to keep the novel in the curriculum.</p>
 								<p>“I just felt that we hadn’t read the same book,” said Stacy Lacy, an English teacher at Centennial High School who signed the petition. “I felt terrible [hearing about the ban] because it is a fantastic book for so many reasons.”</p>

 								<p>According to Lacy, the Meridian school board implied the lexile number of the book was the primary reason behind its removal, rather than inappropriate language. Lexile is a quantitative measurement—determined by the length and number of sentences and paragraphs—used to determine a book’s reading level. Because <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i> is an eighth grade reading level, the board said its lexile is too low for the high school students intended to read it. However, Lacy says that when education reaches high school levels, classes are not necessarily reading for skill but for content and subject matter.</p>
 								<p>Those who fought the challenge also pointed out that the book wasn't required reading. Teachers in the Meridian school district choose the books they will teach each semester from the school district's curriculum book list, which included <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>. Even further, high schools in the Meridian school district have an opt-out option available for students who feel uncomfortable with the novel.</p>

								<h2>IV: The Digital Fight</h2>
								<img src="images/fightchallenges.jpg" class="image" />
								<p>Today, one of the most powerful ways to fight a book challenge may lie in a single tweet. The wide availability of online reporting and instant sharing through social media networks have sped up the process of raising awareness surrounding challenges and bans. Support and criticism no longer just spreads through word of mouth but rather through Facebook statuses, tweets, hashtags and viral content aggregator sites, like Jezebel and Gawker.</p>
								<p>When news of <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>’s removal in Meridian circulated online, Sara Baker, 27, immediately turned to Facebook to share the news. After she and her friend, Jen Lott, began discussing the issue, they decided to create a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/TrueDiary" target="_blank">GoFundMe campaign</a>, where people could donate and help purchase copies of <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i> to be handed out in Meridian, Idaho.</p>
								<p>“By removing it from the curriculum, they were actually just taking away an option from kids who did want to read. And that was what I felt was problematic,” said Baker.</p>
								<p>When their initial goal of 100 books was met within a day of launching the campaign, they increased the number to 350 books as a nod to the number of students who signed the petition. Baker and Lott raised $3,405 and ended up with more than 700 copies, nearly half of which were donated by the book’s publishing company, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.</p>
								<p>Even the book giveaway was organized online because Baker and Lott could not travel from Washington to Idaho. Instead, they used Facebook, email and phone calls to coordinate with several people to hand out the books, including Stacy Lacy, Wally Johnston of Rediscovered Bookshop in Boise, Idaho and Brady Kissel, the student who organized the original student petition. Along with several librarians and teachers, Lacy, Johnston and Kissel handed out copies of Sherman Alexie’s novel at the Julius M. Kleiner Memorial Park on April 23, where hundreds of students, parents and other locals came to take copies home.</p>
								<p>During the giveaway, one man called the police when he saw kids taking the book without parental supervision. Ironically, this escalated the giveaway from a local event into a national story—a turn of events that Baker said she’s thankful for.</p>
								<p>“It’s just 350 kids wanted to read a book and now they’re not going to get to in their classrooms. So this is our way of making an end for it, and I think there are a lot of people in Idaho where this becomes their way of kind of protesting the school board’s decision,” said Baker.</p>
								<p>Johnston said that in reality, the police’s appearance was not a serious concern but their presence made the story go viral. “The Internet found out that someone tried to call the cops on someone giving out free books and everybody got really angry about it,” she said—angry enough to generate hundreds of tweets and inspire stories on publications like <a href="http://gawker.com/parents-call-cops-to-stop-kids-from-handing-out-banned-1569491566" target="_blank">Gawker</a> and <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/88503/parents-call-the-cops-on-student-for-simple-crime-of-standing-up-to-high-school-censorship" target="_blank">Policymic</a> as well as local publications.</p>
								<p>“Through this, I felt first hand the power of social media and the power of the Internet in motivating people to do things that they feel passionately about,” said Lacy.</p>
								<p>According to Lacy, the temporary removal was instrumental in getting more people than ever to read the book. “It helped to make people more aware. Half of the valley wouldn’t have even heard about the book had it not been challenged in the Meridian school district,” she said.</p>
								<p>The Meridian case of <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i> shows that during a time when anything can go viral online, book bans can actually be counterproductive to the banners’ intents. It may simply increase its appeal to teenagers, as is seen by the constant flow of students visiting Rediscovered Books for copies of the book.</p>
								<p>“Of course, you tell anyone not to read something and they want to read it,” Johnston said. “It’s like telling somebody not to scratch an itch: it’s going to drive them crazy until they do. That’s kind of the irony of people trying to ban books.”</p>

								<h2>V: Address, Don't Repress</h2>
								<p>In the case of the graphic novel <i>Persepolis</i> by Marjane Satrapi, Chicago Public Schools decided in March 2013 that it was inappropriate for the seventh grade curriculum and began pulling copies of the book from shelves of public schools. Persepolis is an autobiographical graphic novel about Satrapi’s adolescence in Iran after the Islamic Revolution.</p>
								<p>Levi Todd, a senior at Lane Tech High School, says that librarians went around to classrooms and got every single copy of <i>Persepolis</i> they could find, took them from the catalog and provided a separate sign-in sheet where students could check the book out. When Todd and his friend Alexa Repp organized a protest against the challenge, the event gained attention from Facebook and Twitter, and Repp called news stations like ABC and WGN to attend the protest. In this way, Todd said, technology was crucial in bringing the issue to public prominence.</p>
								<p>The page in question involved a crude drawing of a penis, depicting a torture scene in the story, Todd says. “When I originally looked over the page, I thought it was a whip,” he said. He believes that these drawings were not something children would be frightened of, which led him to think that there may have been another underlying reason for the book’s removal.</p>
								<p>“When it first happened, I joked that it didn’t matter which book they were trying to ban,” Todd said. “If they were trying to ban <i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</i>, it’d be just as upsetting. But I realized that it actually wasn’t true. <i>Persepolis</i> is an autobiography and what the ban was essentially trying to do was block out a piece of history from everyone’s minds. That was a serious issue because they were saying, ‘This is a part of history that is too difficult to think about and we don’t want our kids to hear about it.’”</p>
								<p>Although he understands that parents want to protect their children from controversial material, Todd believes that having children understand history is extremely important, and for that, censorship is not the way to go.</p>
								<p>“You want to talk with them about it, let them read the book,” he said. “If it does bring up difficult situations or topics, it can actually be a great segue to have a one-on-one conversation with your kids."</p>

								<h2>VI: Epilogue</h2>
								<div class="censor">
									<p>We ran into the Reardan High School Library.</p>
									<p>"Look at all these books," he said.</p>
									<p>"There aren't that many," I said. It was a small library in a small high school in a small town.</p>
									<p>"There are three thousand four hundred and twelve books here," Gordy said. "I know that because I counted them."</p>
									<p>"Okay, now you're officially a freak," I said.</p>
									<p>"Yes, it's a small library. It's a tiny one. But if you read one of these books a day, it would still take you almost ten years to finish."</p>
									<p>"What's your point?"</p>
									<p>"The world, even the smallest parts of it, is filled with things you don't know."</p>
									<p>Wow. That was a huge idea.</p>
									<p>Any town, even one as small as Reardan, was a place of mystery. And that meant Wellpinit, the smaller, Indian town, was also a place of mystery.</p>
									<p>"Okay, so it's like each of these books is a mystery. Every book is a mystery. And if you read all of the books ever written, it's like you've read one giant mystery. And no matter how much you learn, you keep on learning so much more you need to learn."</p>
									<p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes," Gordy said. <span class="blackout">"Now doesn't that give you a boner?"</span></p>
									<p><span class="blackout">"I am rock hard," I said.</span></p>
								</div>
									<br>
									<p>When the word “boner” is used to describe one’s love of learning, what becomes more important—the word or the metaphorical message behind it?</p>
									<p>Today’s technology provides the opportunity to bring these discussions online. What used to be an isolated local decision is now information easily shared through the Internet to promote awareness, corral support for both sides and even bring about change.</p>
									<p>The fight to protect freedom of print information is still strong as ever—and with new digital tools, the battle has become even more complex. The issues seen by Meridian and Lane Tech show that through online resources, people can revive and share challenged or banned books with even more zeal and spirit than ever, retaining their right to read. </p>
