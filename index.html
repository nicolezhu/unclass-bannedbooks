								<p>In a time when access to technology is increasing, the ability to keep track of children’s consumption of media is quickly narrowing. Especially for those who challenge books in libraries and schools, the power of social media can be a double-edged sword. In the following chapters, we explore how traditional print/book censorship collides with the modern mindset and tools of today’s society.</p>

								<p>Imagine yourself reading this as a 17-year-old. Could you handle it?</p>
								<p>This sentence is just one of several controversial lines in the The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie. The book is an award-winning novel told from the perspective of a 14-year-old boy named Junior who leaves the Spokane Indian reservation for an all-white public high school in pursuit of a better education. Fans and educators praise the novel for its frank portrayal of one young man’s hardships growing up on an Indian reservation.  But according to Deborah Caldwell of the American Library Association, it appears to be the most controversial novel of 2014 thus far.</p>
								<p>Most recently, the book was challenged and temporarily removed from the supplemental book list in the Meridian school district curriculum in Idaho. Parents raised concerns about profane, racist and sexual language, prompting the Meridian school board to vote 2-1 to place a temporary hold on the book until it found a more appropriate replacement. The decision was made despite a petition signed by 350 students asking to keep the book in the curriculum.</p>
								<p>“I just felt that we hadn’t read the same book,” said Stacy Lacy, an English teacher at Centennial High School. “I felt terrible because it is a fantastic book for so many reasons.”</p>

								<p>Lacy said that the board implied that the lexile number of the book was the primary reason behind its removal. Lexile is a quantitative measurement—determined by the length and number of sentences and paragraphs—used to determine a book’s reading level. The board said because The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian is an eighth grade reading level, its lexile is too low for the high school students intended to read it.</p>
								<p>Those who fought the challenge also pointed out the fact that the book was already an optional read. According to Lacy, teachers in the Meridian school district choose the books they will teach each semester from the school district's curriculum book list, which included Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Even further, high schools in the Meridian school district have an opt-out option available for students who feel uncomfortable with the novel.</p>

														<p>Sherman Alexie’s “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” was initially published in September 2007 under Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. It too lands on the ALA’s list due to inclusion of concepts such as offensive language, racism, sex education, sexually explicit nature, unsuitability to an age group, and violence. It has appeared on the list on four consecutive occasions from 2010 to 2013. The book chronicles one Native American teenager’s coming of age story through frank humor. Most recently, it was involved in a controversy regarding it’s challenge in Idaho schools throughout early 2014.</p>

														<p>Marjane Satrapi’s “Persepolis” was published at the turn of the century in 2000 through 2003 through Pantheon. Its inclusion of imagery has been the source of a plethora of controversy. The controversy of torture imagery in comic book type illustrations within the novel has caused it to be removed in schools of the Chicago Public School System in 2013. The communications department of CPS has denied any type of banning, but the controversy has remained and there have been talks of getting specific training for any instructors who want to use the book as teaching material for a class. Despite this controversy, the coming of age story for an Iranian youth during the Islamic revolution had a film adaptation in 2007.</p>

While published on September 14, 2008 by Scholastic, it has received a film adaptation that has also drawn praise and popularity from a wider audience, starting with the first film of the trilogy premiering in 2012. The book was landed on the number five spot of the most frequently challenged list again in 2013, following the trend of the previous years—2010 and 2011. The reasons for its challenge have been the religious viewpoint, that it is unsuited to an age group, anti-ethnic, anti-family, contains insensitivity, offensive language, violence, and is considered occult/satanic.</p>

								<h2>IV: The Digital Fight</h2>
								<img src="images/fightchallenges.jpg" class="image" />
								<p>Today, one of the most powerful ways to fight a book challenge may lie in a single tweet. The wide availability of online reporting and instant sharing through social media networks have sped up the process of raising awareness surrounding challenges and bans. Support and criticism no longer just spreads through word of mouth but rather through Facebook statuses, tweets, hashtags and viral content aggregator sites, like Jezebel and Gawker.</p>
								<p>When news of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian’s removal in Meridian circulated online, Sara Baker, 27, immediately turned to Facebook to share the news. When she and her friend, Jen Lott, began discussing the issue, they decided to create a GoFundMe campaign, where people could donate and help purchase copies of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian to be handed out in Meridian, Idaho.</p>
								<p>“By removing it from the curriculum, they were actually just taking away an option from kids who did want to read. And that was what I felt was problematic,” said Baker.</p>
								<p>When their initial goal of 100 books was met within a day of launching the campaign, they increased the number to 350 books as a nod to the number of students who signed the petition. Baker and Lott raised $3,405 and ended up with over 700 copies, nearly half of which were donated by the book’s publishing company, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.</p>
								<p>Even the book giveaway was organized online because Baker and Lott could not travel from Washington to Idaho. Instead, they used Facebook, email and phone calls to coordinate with several people to hand out the books, including Stacy Lacy, Wally Johnston of Rediscovered Bookshop in Boise, Idaho and Brady Kissel, the student who organized the original student petition. Along with several librarians and teachers, Lacy, Johnston and Kissel handed out copies of Sherman Alexie’s novel at the Julius M. Kleiner Memorial Park on April 23, where hundreds of students, parents and other locals came to take copies home.</p>
								<p>During the giveaway, one man called the police when he saw kids taking the book without parental supervision. Ironically, this escalated the giveaway from a local event into a national story—a turn of events that Baker said she’s thankful for.</p>
								<p>“It’s just 350 kids wanted to read a book and now they’re not going to get to in their classrooms. So this is our way of making an end for it, and I think there are a lot of people in Idaho where this becomes their way of kind of protesting the school board’s decision. We just gave them the tool to do it,” said Baker.</p>
								<p>Johnston said that in reality, the police’s appearance was not that big of a deal but their presence got made the story go viral. “The internet found out that someone tried to call the cops on someone giving out free books and everybody got really angry about it,” she said— angry enough to generate hundreds of tweets and inspire stories on publications like Gawker and Jezebel as well as local publications.</p>
								<p>“Through this, I felt first hand the power of social media and the power of the internet in motivating people to do things that they feel passionately about,” said Lacy.</p> 
								<p>According to Lacy, the temporary removal was instrumental in getting more people than ever to read the book. “It helped to make people more aware. Half of the valley wouldn’t have even heard about the book had it not been challenged in the Meridian school district,” she said.</p>
								<p>The Meridian case of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian shows that during a time when anything can go viral online, book bans can actually be counterproductive to the banners’ intents. It may simply increase its appeal to teenagers, as is seen by the constant flow of students visiting Rediscovered Books for copies of the book.</p>
								<p>“Of course, you tell anyone not to read something and they want to read it,” Johnston said. “It’s like telling somebody not to scratch an itch: it’s going to drive them crazy until they do. That’s kind of the irony of people trying to ban books.”</p>
								<p>In the case of the graphic novel Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi, Chicago Public Schools decided in March 2013 that it was inappropriate to be taught in seventh grade curriculum and began pulling copies of the book from shelves of public schools. Persepolis is an autobiographical novel about Satrapi’s adolescence in Iran after the Islamic revolution.</p>
								<p>Levi Todd, a senior at Lane Tech High School, said that librarians went around to classrooms and got every single copy of Persepolis they could find, took them from the catalog and provided a separate sign-in sheet where students could check it out. When Todd and his friend Alexa Repp organized a protest against the challenge, the event gained attention from Facebook and Twitter and Repp called news stations like ABC and WGN to come down to the protest. In this way, Todd said, technology was crucial in bringing the issue to public prominence.</p>
								<p>According to him, the page of Persepolis in question involved a crude drawing of a penis, depicting a torture scene in the story. “When I originally looked over the page, I thought it was a whip,” he said. He believes that these drawings were not something children would be frightened of, which led him to think that there may have been another underlying reason for the book’s removal.</p>
								<p>“When it first happened, I joked that it didn’t matter which book they were trying to ban,” Todd said. “If they were trying to ban Goldilocks and the Three Bears, it’d be just as upsetting. But I realized that it actually wasn’t true. Persepolis is an autobiography and what the ban was essentially trying to do was block out a piece of history from everyone’s minds. That was a serious issue because they were saying, ‘This is a part of history that is too difficult to think about and we don’t want our kids to hear about it.’”</p>
								<p>Todd said that although he understands that parents want to protect their children from controversial material, he believes that having children understand history is extremely important, and for that, censorship is not the way to go.</p>
								<p>“You want to talk with them about it, let them read the book,” he said. “If it does bring up difficult situations or topics, it can actually be a great segue to have a one on one conversation with your kids."</p>

								<h2>V: Epilogue</h2>
								<div class="censor">
									<p>We ran into the Reardan High School Library.</p>
									<p>"Look at all these books," he said.</p>
									<p>"There aren't that many," I said. It was a small library in a small high school in a small town.</p>
									<p>"There are three thousand four hundred and twelve books here," Gordy said. "I know that because I counted them."</p>
									<p>"Okay, now you're officially a freak," I said.</p>
									<p>"Yes, it's a small library. It's a tiny one. But if you read one of these books a day, it would still take you almost ten years to finish."</p>
									<p>"What's your point?"</p>
									<p>"The world, even the smallest parts of it, is filled with things you don't know."</p>
									<p>Wow. That was a huge idea.</p>
									<p>Any town, even one as small as Reardan, was a place of mystery. And that meant Wellpinit, the smaller, Indian town, was also a place of mystery.</p>
									<p>"Okay, so it's like each of these books is a mystery. Every book is a mystery. And if you read all of the books ever written, it's like you've read one giant mystery. And no matter how much you learn, you keep on learning so much more you need to learn."</p>
									<p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes," Gordy said. <span class="blackout">"Now doesn't that give you a boner?"</span></p>
									<p><span class="blackout">"I am rock hard," I said.</span></p>
								</div>
									<br>
									<p>When the word “boner” is used to describe one’s love of learning, what becomes more important—the word or the metaphorical message behind it? The inappropriate words that people object to and the frank writing are what reaches the kids, said Lacy.</p>
									<p>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian is currently temporarily removed from the curriculum book list until an appropriate replacement is found. How the board will administrate the search for an alternative book is yet to be determined.</p>
