								<p>Book bans have been around for centuries. But in a time when everyone has access to technology, the ability to keep track of what media kids consume is quickly narrowing. Especially for those who challenge books in libraries and schools, the power of social media can be a double-edged sword. In the following chapters, we explore how this age-old process of censorship collides with the modern mindset of today’s society.</p>

								<h2>Chapter One</h2>
								<p>In Meridian, Idaho, the book <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> by Sherman Alexie was recently challenged and temporarily removed from the Meridian school district curriculum’s supplemental book list. The book is an award-winning novel told from the perspective of a 14-year-old boy named Junior who leaves the Spokane Indian reservation for an all-white public high school in pursuit of a better education. </p>
								<p>Parents raised concerns about profane, racist and sexual language, prompting the Meridian school board to vote 2-1 to place a temporary hold on the book until they found a more appropriate replacement. The decision was made despite a petition signed by 350 students asking to keep the book in the curriculum.</p>

								<h2>Chapter Two</h2>
								<p>This section will include an infographic on the process of a book challenge</p>
								<p>There are many levels to the process of challenging a book. It all starts with a concern. An individual, often a parent, will express concern for a book for whatever reason. This usually leads to a conversation with a teacher or school or library administration, with an oral or written complaint to the book or material concerned, challenging its value.</p>
								<p>Often the process stops here, with complaints handled before reaching the next level. Nancy Figel (must check on last name), a librarian at Evanston Township High School, said that if a parent raises concerns about particular material in a book, they often simply want someone to listen to what they have to say and at the most, receive a clear explanation of why the book is being taught and the value it has to students.</p>
								<p>But other times, the process continues as individuals push for censorship and restricted access to books they deem to be “sexually explicit,” contain “offensive language” or are “unsuited to any age group” — the top three reasons listed by the Office of Intellectual Freedom behind why books have been challenged in the past.</p>
								<p>From there, a smaller committee within the school or library is formed to address the challenge. This committee reads the questioned book in its entirety and then evaluates the book against TK policy. Its decision is delivered through a letter to the original challenger, and if this person is unsatisfied, they have the right to appeal. An appeal involves the school board or library board of directors, who may hold a public hearing or meeting, and will ultimately vote to censor the book in some way - whether it be banning it from curriculum, requiring extra training for teachers who to teach it, or putting a temporary hold on it like Meridian school districts.</p>

								<h3>The Problem with Persepolis</h3>
								<p>In the case of the graphic novel <em>Persepolis</em> by Marjane Satrapi, Chicago Public Schools decided in March 2013 that it was inappropriate to be taught in seventh grade curriculum and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/15/cps-persepolis-ban_n_2883999.html" target="_blank">began pulling copies of the book from shelves of public schools</a>. Persepolis is an autobiographical novel about Satrapi’s adolescence in Iran after the Islamic revolution.</p>
								<p>Levi Todd, a senior at Lane Tech High School, said that the whole situation was kept under the radar and that CPS did not expect so much backlash from the community. According to him, the page of <em>Persepolis</em> in question involved a crude drawing of a penis, depicting a torture scene in the story. “When I originally looked over the page, I thought it was a whip,” he said. He believes that these drawings were not something children would be frightened of, which led him to think that there may have been another underlying reason for the book’s removal.</p>
								<p>“When it first happened, I joked that it didn’t matter which book they were trying to ban,” Todd said. “If they were trying to ban <em>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</em>, it’d be just as upsetting. But I realized that it actually wasn’t true. <em>Persepolis</em> is an autobiography and what the ban was essentially trying to do was block out a piece of history from everyone’s minds. That was a serious issue because they were saying, ‘This is a part of history that is too difficult to think about and we don’t want our kids to hear about it.’”</p>
								<p>Todd said that although he understands that parents want to protect their children from controversial material, he believes that having children understand history is extremely important, and for that, censorship is not the way to go.</p>
								<p>“You want to talk with them about it, let them read the book,” he said. “If it does bring up difficult situations or topics, it can actually be a great segue to have a one on one conversation with your kids."</p>

								<h2>Chapter Three</h2>
								<p id="quote">“It’s kind of the ‘out of sight out of mind’ mentality to it. People ban books that they feel threatened by because it challenges their thinking or their norms or acceptable behavior and language they feel comfortable with … [For Persepolis,] I think that’s the thinking that was challenged. Instead of talking about what was so upsetting about it, they wanted to push it aside.” <br><span id="quote-ref">- Levi Todd</span></p>

								<h2>Chapter Four</h2>
								<p>Attempts to remove material from school curriculums or libraries are in direct opposition to the Library Bill of Rights, which promotes the nature and importance of intellectual freedom in libraries. The American Library Association actively fights censorship and provides numerous resources to help people do the same, whether it’s strategies for conducting a challenge hearing or forms for submitting requests for reconsideration for library resources. Banned Books Week is an annual event typically held during the last week of September celebrating the freedom to read. Initially started in 1982 in response to a surge in the number of book challenges in schools, bookstores and libraries, Banned Books Week unites the book community in drawing national attention to the harmful effects of censorship. Libraries and bookstores host events such as dramatic readings, trivia contests, photo galleries and discussions of banned books. Other groups such as OIF and the Freedom to Read Foundation (FTRF) also focus heavily on implementing ALA policies regarding free access to libraries and materials both through advocacy and legal defense.</p>
								<p>Unlike public libraries, school libraries are responsible for supporting and supplementing a curriculum while providing materials for the diverse backgrounds, maturity levels and reading skills of the student body. When it comes to book challenges in schools, the responsibility ultimately falls on the library director school superintendent, who is in charge of selecting books that work within the framework of established policies.</p>
								<p>Methods of fighting book challenges have taken hold on the internet. Through the technology and social media outlets available to everyone, it’s difficult to imagine a challenge traveling through all the steps to becoming a ban without huge backlash from a virtual public.</p>
								<p>Stacy Lacy, an English teacher at Centennial High School, said that teachers in the Meridian school district choose what books they will teach each semester from a list of books district's curriculum. <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> was included on that list.</p>
								<p>“I just felt like that we hadn’t read the same book.” Lacy said of the arguments against the book. “I felt terrible because it is a fantastic book for so many reasons.”  </p>
								<p>For those who fought the challenge, one of their biggest issues lay in the fact that the book was already an optional read. Because teachers choose which books they will teach each year, it is not guaranteed that students will read <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> in school at all. Even further, Centennial High School has an opt-out option available for students who feel uncomfortable with the novel.</p>
								<p>“By removing it from the curriculum, they were actually just taking away an option from kids who did want to read. And that was what I felt was problematic,” said Sara Baker, a student at University of Washington.</p>
								<p>When Baker, 27, read about the book’s removal, she immediately turned to social media. Baker and her friend Jen decided to create a GoFundMe campaign, where people could donate and help purchase copies of <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> to be handed out in TK, Idaho. When their initial goal of 100 books was met within 24 hours, they increased the number to 350 books as a nod to the number of students who signed the petition. Baker and TK ultimately raised $3,405 and ended up with over 700 copies. About half the copies were donated by Sherman Alexie’s publisher, a company that had discovered the campaign online.</p>
								<p>Because Baker and TK could not travel from Washington, they used Facebook, email and phone calls to coordinate with several people - including Wally Johnston of Rediscovered Bookshop in Idaho and Brady Kissel, the student who organized the original student petition - about giving copies away. Along with several librarians and teachers, Johnston and Kissel handed out copies of Sherman Alexie’s controversial novel at the TK park on April TK, where hundreds of students, parents and other locals came to take copies home.</p>
								<p>During the giveaway, one man saw that children were taking free copies of the book and called the police. By inviting law enforcement, this man unknowingly helped the story gain online presence. Johnston said that in reality, the police’s appearance was not that big of a deal. But because the internet found out that someone called the cops, everyone was really angry and it ended up generating hundreds of tweets and stories on publications like Gawker and Jezebel.</p>
								<p>“Through this, I felt first hand the power of social media and the power of the internet in motivating people to do things that they feel passionately about,” said Lacy, who helped plan the GoFundMe and book giveaway. “I think that technology and social media is crucial to keeping people aware of what’s going on.”</p>
								<p>According to Lacy, the removal was instrumental in getting more people than ever to read the book. “Half of the valley wouldn’t have even heard about the book had it not been challenged in the Meridian school district,” she said.</p>
								<p>The Meridian case of <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> shows that during a time when anything can go viral, book bans can actually be counterproductive to the banners’ intents. It may simply increase its appeal to teenagers, as is seen by the constant flow of students visiting Rediscovered Books for copies of the book.</p>
								<p>“Of course, you tell anyone not to read something and they want to read it,” Johnston said. “It’s like telling somebody not to scratch an itch: it’s going to drive them crazy until they do. That’s kind of the irony of people trying to ban books.”</p>
								<p>In the spring of 2012, Todd and a few of his friends started a banned books club at Lane Tech called 451 Degrees. They started by reading some historically banned books, including <em>Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em>.</p>
								<p>“CPS had not had a history [of banning books], so we never thought we’d become so relevant,” Todd said of the club during the time of <em>Persepolis</em>’s controversy.</p>
								<p>He said that librarians at Lane Tech went around to classrooms and got every single copy of <em>Persepolis</em> they could find, took them from the catalog and provided a separate sign-in sheet where students could check it out. Todd and his friend Alexa Repp, who was also upset about the censorship, organized a protest against the challenge. After getting attention from Facebook and Twitter, Repp called news stations like ABC and WGN to come down to the protest. In this way, Todd said, technology was crucial in bringing the issue to public prominence.</p>
